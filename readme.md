# DevFest New Orleans 2019 Website

This website was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React starter for SSR or static sites. [Styled components](https://www.styled-components.com) is used for styling.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and go to http://localhost:3000. To use another port, you can run `npm run dev -- -p <your port here>`.

To deploy as an app with SSR, run `npm run build` then `npm start`.

To deploy as a static website, run `npm export` which both performs the build and the export. Now you can deploy the `out` directory to any static hosting service.

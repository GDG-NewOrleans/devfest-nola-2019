# DevFest New Orleans 2019 Website

This website was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React starter for SSR or static sites. [Styled components](https://www.styled-components.com) is used for styling.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, cd into it, then run `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and go to http://localhost:3000. To use another port, you can run `npm run dev -- -p <your port here>`.

To deploy as a static website, run `npm export` which both performs the build and the export. Now you can deploy the `out` directory to any static hosting service.

The master branch is automatically statically deployed to https://happy-lichterman-b0a93a.netlify.com/.

  bio: "I’m a fun-loving geek who is driven to create useful things (mostly with code) almost as much as I am called to teach others how to do it themselves. I enjoy diving into data and have been known to get lost in SQL at times. I’m passionate about clean, purposeful interfaces and joyous user experiences. I work on video encoding and user recommendations at TED Conferences and teach software engineering and internet technologies at Loyola University New Orleans. I’m the Brigade Captain of Code for New Orleans. I read lots of books, but never seem to get through my reading list. I’m a happy husband and father of two."

  title: Modeling the conceptual structure of ffmpeg in JavaScript
  id: ffmpeg
  speakerId: ryan
  speaker: Ryan Harvey
  description: >
    A core tool in many video developers’ workflows, ffmpeg has a frustratingly steep learning curve and a difficult syntax to master. Many video developers write code to automate ffmpeg runs, and Node.js is a popular way to do that. However, current JavaScript interfaces to ffmpeg do nothing to ease the underlying difficulty of the tool. In this talk, I’ll introduce you to a new library I’ve built for Node.js to make that process easier and lessen the learning curve, covering both conceptual structure and motivation, as well as practical examples.

    Account takeovers continue to be part of major security incidents. Decades of password education haven't helped. Phishing campaigns have become more effective than ever. Sometimes it seems like we're losing. But there is hope! The WebAuthn protocol provides a stronger way for users to authenticate. It uses secure hardware and asymmetric cryptography to provide a strong addition to passwords, or a replacement. Best of all, it's easy to implement, and already widely supported. Come to this talk to learn how WebAuthn works, how you can use it yourself, and how to add support to your software.

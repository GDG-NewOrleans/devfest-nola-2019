  title: Modeling the conceptual structure of ffmpeg in JavaScript
  id: ffmpeg
  speakerId: ryan
  speaker: Ryan Harvey
  description: >
    A core tool in many video developers’ workflows, ffmpeg has a frustratingly steep learning curve and a difficult syntax to master and remember. Many video developers write code to automate ffmpeg runs for encoding, overlays, and more, and Node.js is a popular way to do that. However, current JavaScript interfaces to ffmpeg do nothing to ease the underlying difficulty of the tool. Instead, they mostly provide a one-to-one mapping of command line options in ffmpeg to method calls in JavaScript. In this talk, I will introduce a new JavaScript library for working with ffmpeg.

  title: CSS for People That Hate CSS

  speaker: Robin Dykema
  description: >
    CSS is a deceptively difficult concept to master. Many developers brush off polishing their CSS skills, thinking to themselves, “I’m not great at design anyway.” However, CSS is the final presentation layer that your users see. Poorly written CSS can leave a bad taste in your users’ mouthes, even if the JavaScript / backend code behind the CSS is excellent. This talk will help developers understand what concepts to focus on if interested in improving their beginner or intermediate level CSS skills.

  speaker: Ekaba Bisong
  description: >
    The talk will cover the newly released TensorFlow 2.0 and its exciting features for developing machine learning models and deploying them within a software product. Some of these new features include a more pythonic feel to model design and debugging, using tf.function to transform a Python method into high-performance TensorFlow graphs, using Keras as the core high-level API for model design, using FeatureColumns to parse data as input into Keras models, and the ease of training on distributed architectures and devices. In addition, the talk will highlight the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) toolset for deploying machine learning models as software products. Example of these tools includes TensorFlow Data Validation to analyze large-scale datasets, TensorFlow Model Analysis to visualize model metrics for deployment and TensorFlow Serving for deploying models.

  title: Designing against Domestic Violence
  id: designingagainst
  speakerId: eva
  speaker: Eva PenzeyMoog
  description: >
    The reality of domestic violence doesn’t disappear when people enter the digital world. Abusers use technology to exploit and control their victims, meaning that technologists have a responsibility to ensure that users of our products are empowered to protect their safety. How can we prevent people with violent intentions from forms of abuse and control that are digital, such as exploiting online banking software to control a partners finances or tormenting them with smart home devices? How can we recognize points of possible intervention where we might be able to help a user who is experiencing domestic violence? How can we make it harder for stalkers to find their victims? While there’s no simple answer and ultimately no way to ensure our users’ safety in all situations, thoughtful considerations and small changes while designing and building products can and does result in meaningful contributions to people’s safety. This talk will help the audience get into the right mindset for thinking about safety and provide a framework for building technology against domestic violence.
